            <h2>Topic: Object-Oriented Programming  </h2>
            <h2>Instructor(s): Jaime Davila, Cole Reilly</h1>
            <p>This course will expose students to programming practices beyond the introductory level, concentrating on Object Oriented Programming techniques and an introduction to Data Structures. Students will also study and analyze the complexity of both the algorithms presented in class and of the algorithms they develop. This course also provides experience with the development and analysis of recursive algorithms and programs. Before taking this course, students are expected to have been exposed to the following concepts through a college-level course or equivalent in some high level computer programming language: input and output operations, conditional statements, loops, arrays, recursion, and functions/methods. The course places an emphasis on the careful design and testing of programs. (Gen. Ed. R2) Open to freshmen, sophomores, and juniors in Computer Science and Informatics. Prerequisite: CICS 110 (previously INFO 190S) or COMPSCI 121 with a grade of C or above. 4 credits.</p>
